# Projections

1. Implement a program that projects a 3d convex shape (e.g. a cube) into the plane $z = -1$ using a central projection with all facets visible.

2. Implement a program that projects a 3d convex shape (e.g. a cube) into the plane $z = -1$ using a central projection with only those planes visible that face the camera.

   To determine, whether the plane is facing the camera, calculate the normal vector for the plane using [the cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product).
   The normal vector projection on the plane $z$ must be positive.
